Packard Fellow, Sloan Fellow, ACM Fellow


I am a Professor with a joint appointment in CSD and ECE at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). My research interests include cryptography, security, mechanism design, algorithms, foundations of blockchains, and programming languages. I'm a co-founder of [Oblivious Labs, Inc](https://obliviouslabs.com). My research on Oblivious RAM and differentially private algorithms have been adopted by [Signal](https://signal.org/blog/building-faster-oram/), [Meta](https://github.com/facebook/oram), and Google.
