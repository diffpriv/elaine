This thesis describes crypto techniques for building 
privacy-preserving Gmail and privacy-preserving Google Docs.

<big><b>Private Gmail</b><br></big>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alice loves Gmail. However, she is paranoid about her privacy, and she does not
wish Google to read her emails.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The good old way to address such privacy concerns is to use encryption.
Imagine that Alice now uses traditional public-key encryption to protect the secrecy
of her emails. Alice generates a public-key/private-key pair.
She publishes the public-key PK, so her friends can encrypt the emails using PK
before sending them to Alice. Now all emails will be stored in encrypted format at Google,
and Alice is happy about being able to protect her privacy.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now Alice wishes to search for all emails whose 
"(sender = Bob) and (date within [2006, 2007])". Unfortunately,
Google can no longer perform search for her, since the emails are stored in encrypted format, and
without the secret key, the emails look like random junk to Google.
Alice can download all emails from Google, decrypt and search them locally. But what if
there are too many emails to download?
Alternatively, Alice can give away her private-key to Google, but of course, that beats the purpose of encryption.

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
This problem can be solved using a new type of encryption, called <span style="color: rgb(25, 25, 130);"> predicate encryption</span>.
Using predicate encryption,  Alice can compute a capability corresponding to her query, e.g., 
"(sender = Bob) and (date within [2006, 2007])". 
She gives this capability to Google, and Google can test the capability
against Alice's encrypted emails. 
In this way, Google is able to learn which emails match the query; and
beyond this information, Google learns nothing more about the encrypted emails.
With predicate encryption, access to the plaintext is no-longer all-or-nothing. One can release
partial information about the encrypted data, and in a controlled manner. 


<br>  
&nbsp; &nbsp;
One important goal of predicate 
encryption is to support expressive query predicates.
Previously, researchers have proposed efficient constructions for performing
simple keyword-based queries, a.k.a., equality tests.
This thesis proposes a new construction supporting conjunctions of range queries which are more expressive
than simple keyword-based queries.
It is worth noting that shortly after this research, Katz, Sahai and Waters propose a 
new scheme that support even more powerful queries, namely, inner-product queries.
<br>
<br>

<big><b>Private Google Docs</b><br></big>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Public-key predicate encryption schemes guarantee the secrecy of the ciphertext;
however, they do not guarantee the secrecy of the tokens.
In fact, for public-key predicate encryption, 
it is inherently impossible
to achieve ciphertext secrecy and token secrecy simultaneously.
This is due to the fact that anyone is able to encrypt using the public-key.
For example, if Google would like to know whether a token corresponds to the query "title = xxx", 
Google can simply encrypt "title = xxx" using the public-key, and test the token
against the resulting ciphertext.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
We propose a secret-key predicate encryption scheme that protect the secrecy
of the ciphertext and tokens simultaneously. Our scheme supports inner-product queries.

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
A cool application of this scheme is private Google Docs.
Alice stores her documents on Google Docs. Like Gmail, Google Docs has this cool feature that it
allows Alices to search her documents. For example, Alice may wish to retrieve
all documents "(date within 2007) or (title contains <i>crypto</i>)".
Again, she cares about her privacy, and do not wish Google to read her documents.

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But how is this different from private Gmail?
Gmail calls for a public-key scheme, since anyone should be able to send email to Alice. 
With Google Docs, Alice is the only content creator, so she can use a secret-key
scheme that achieves better privacy gurantee: both her documents 
and her queries are now private.

<big><b>Delegating capabilities in predicate encryption</b><br></big>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In predicate encryption systems, it is often important for a user holding a capability (or a set
of capabilities) to generate another capability that is more restrictive than the ones she currently
holds. 
We say that a predicate encryption system allows for delegation
if a user can create capabilities that are more restrictive than the ones she currently owns and if
she can do this operation autonomously; that is, without interacting with an authority.
In this thesis, we investigate how to delegate capabilities in predicate encryption.
